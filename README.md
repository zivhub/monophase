# Monophase <!-- omit in toc -->

Monophase is *a one-column minimal responsive Jekyll blog theme*.

One of the purposes of Monophase is to be an alternative option to the default theme of Jekyll—[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Monophase is still keeping minimal, but meanwhile, more beautiful and mellow, and doesn't lose some useful basic features, such as archive.

Check the *[live demo](https://zivlog.io/monophase/)*.

### Homepage

You can create a homepage for your blog by setting `layout: home` in your `index.html`.

### Custom Head

Monophase leaves a placeholder to allow defining custom head. All you need to do is putting data into `_includes/custom-head.html`, and they would be automatically included in `<head>`.

### Navigation

The navigation bar of Monophase is configurable. You just need to specify titles and URLs in the file `_data/navigation.yml`, for example,

```yml
- title: About
  url: /about/
- title: Archive
  url: /archive/
- title: Categories
  url: /categories/
```

### Social Links

Monophase allows you to show social links on the website. All you need to do is creating a file `_data/social.yml`, for example,

```yml
- title: Email
  url: mailto:zivmsg@gmail.com
  icon: fas fa-envelope
- title: Twitter
  url: https://twitter.com/zivtwt
  icon: fab fa-twitter
- title: GitHub
  url: https://github.com/zivhub
  icon: fab fa-github
```

### Alert Messages

Monophase provides some predefined classes to specify different levels of **alert messages**. In order of tone from light to heavy, they are: `message-info`, `message-warning`, and `message-danger`. You may add it to single elements like a `<p>`, or to a parent if there are multiple elements to show.

### Alignment

Monophase also provides some predefined classes to specify the alignment of HTML elements—e.g. images. They are `align-center`, `align-left`, and `align-right`.

### Google Analytics 4

To enable [Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en), you just need to set the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en) in your `_config.yml`, for example,

```yml
google_analytics: G-XXXXXXX
```

### CountAPI

[CountAPI](https://countapi.xyz) is a very simple counting service. It can be enabled to serve as a very basic page counter by setting the CountAPI namespace in your `_config.yml`, for example,
```yml
countapi: mysite.github.io
```

Note that keys are based on `page.url` by eliminating the forward slashes (`/`) and truncating to 63 characters. Keep this in mind when creating documents ([allowed character set for keys](https://countapi.xyz/#format)).

### Archive

Monophase provides some built-in archive pages. It is implemented in pure Liquid. If you want to archive posts by years, you can create a page and put these code in it:

```yml
---
layout: archive
type: years
---
```

Similarly, if you want to archive posts by categories or tags, you can set the `type` property as `categories` or `tags`.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at [https://github.com/zivhub/monophase](https://github.com/zivhub/monophase). This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `monophase.gemspec` accordingly.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
